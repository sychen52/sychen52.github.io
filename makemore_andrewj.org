* kaiming_init is no long that important
(sqrt(1/fan_in) is good enough, the gain is not that important.
This is because the bn, skip connection...

* How to choose learning rate
1. pick a lr that is too smaller. (by using it to train for a few thousand steps: not converge fast enough)
2. pick a lr that is too large. (by using it to train for a few thousand steps: not converge at all)
3. train a few thousand steps with lr increased gradually from the too small one to the too large one *in log scale*.
4. plot loss vs lr curve and pick a lr in the bottom (log log scale to see better)


* How to choose learning rate (Approach 2)
1. compute the stat of abs(lr*grad)/abs(parameter) for all the layers.
2. The value should be around 1e-3 (1e-2 to 1e-4).
