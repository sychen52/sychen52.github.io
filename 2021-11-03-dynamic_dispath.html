This is a note for [this lecture](<a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/programming-languages-part-c/optional-dynamic-dispatch-manually-in-racket-FiXQW">https://www.coursera.org/lecture/programming-languages-part-c/optional-dynamic-dispatch-manually-in-racket-FiXQW</a>).
</p>

<p>
Dynamic dispatch is a unique feature of WHOOP. The main difference between a dynamic dispatched method vs. a closure is that: the `self` in it refers to the current object.
</p>

<p>
It sounds simple, but when you use dynamic dispatch in OOP, it feels like (especially when `self` is implicit.), although you do not override this method itself, its behavior may change because you override other methods that this method calls. In contrast, when you define a closure, its environment is "frozen" at that moment, the free variables, the other methods.
</p>

<p>
In this lecture, Dan implemented dynamic dispatch in Racket. And all it needs is to give all methods an additional argument called `self`. Since `self` is an argument, it is not frozen. It is passed in when called. This is exactly "dynamic dispatch".
</p>

<p>
Details of the racket implementation:
</p>

<p>
## Class
a struct with a list of variables and a list of functions/methods. Note that every function has an extra argument `self`.
</p>

<p>
## Constructor
a function that returns an instance of a struct.
</p>

<p>
## Inheritance
It is done through constructor. It constructs a "base class" struct first, and then add new variables and methods to it.
</p>

<p>
## Call a method of an object
look up the function in the object's list first, and then call it with the `self` argument being the object itself.
