These are my notes while watch this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxO-6rlihSg&list=PLT1Q-TlUqiDYIRVZqnSrl5PQOu2W282EC&index=8&t=128s][Youtube video]].

* Composition
** Horizontal horizons
** Rule of thirds: Give subjects room to MOVE into or SEE into (nose room).
   - almost always better than just put the subject in the middle
   - An exception is lake, where the symmetry is key.
** Framing
   - Have some stuff close but not in focus to show the depth.
   - Otherwise, the scene far away looks flat.
** Check your backgrounds!
   - Change your view point to find a better background to make subject standout (contrast in terms of color).
   - The ant with a green leaf as background to standout.
** Fill the Frame
   - No need to fit everything in.
** Leading lines
   - even better if the line start at the corner of the image
** Anything but eye-level
   - at least as low as you subject.
** Look for details
** Take vertical photos
** Break these rules

* Exposure
** Most time auto is good.
** Adjust manually when in snow, bright windows. No need to play with different metering mode.
** Use histogram to check exposure. Sometimes the small screen is hard to see.
** Spot meter is for studio when they have a gray card.

* Modes
** Rule of thumb
*** If you want to explicitly control the shutter speed, then S mode.
   - Use when the subject is moving (faster shutter speed),
   - Or then you want a slower than normal shutter speed, e.g. water fall, motion blur.

*** When the ideal shutter speed (e.g. 1/100) is fast enough, then A mode.
   - Stationary scene or portrait.

** Aperture mode + auto ISO: 
   - Compute the slowest shutter speed based on focal length to be hand-shake-proof.
   - Ideal state: the hand-shake-proof shutter speed (e.g. 1/100s), the lowest ISO (e.g. 160).
   - If environment is darker, keep ideal shutter speed, use higher ISO.
     If highest ISO riches, even slower shutter speed.
   - If environment is brighter, keep the lowest ISO, faster shutter speed.

** Shutter speed mode + auto ISO: 
   - Largest f and smallest ISO is the darkest it can get.
   - It will first reduce f, then increase ISO.
   - The logic of this mode is simpler than Aperture mode because you control the shutter speed and there is no hand-shake-proof ideal shutter speed.

** Manual mode: often used in studio
   - When the environment does not change, so you do not want the camera to auto choose A, S, ISO every time.
   - Also, when you have some way to measure you are having good exposure.

** Program mode: different combo between A and S.
   - You have to adjust the combo every time. It is better than auto mode, but not as good as S or A mode where you have direct control.

* Lighting
** Close to (1 hour before and after) sunrise or sunset is good.
** Lighting in cloudy day is good. (Although the sky does not look good.)
** Find/create a shade in harsh sunlight.
** Fill-Flash: use flashlight in harsh sunlight to get rid of the shadow.
** Direct flashlight at night is too fake. Use some indirect light.

* Focus
When you set a focus point/distance, if the depth that is in focus is d, the focus point is at 1/3 of d. This is why you focus on eyes.
